# IBM-Introduction-to-HTML-CSS-JavaScript-Course
Coursera IBM Introduction to HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript Course projects
This project is a personal portfolio webpage developed as part of the Introduction to HTML, CSS, & JavaScript course. The goal was to apply the fundamental concepts learned in class by building a functional, visually appealing, and responsive webpage that showcases my skills, projects, and contact information.

The portfolio serves as both a practical exercise in front-end development and a foundation for future, more advanced projects.
