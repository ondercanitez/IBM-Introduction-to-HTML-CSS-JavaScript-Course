# IBM-Introduction-to-HTML-CSS-JavaScript-Course

This repository contains all the projects I completed throughout the Introduction to HTML, CSS & JavaScript course. During the course, I learned fundamental web development skills and applied them by building various projects. These helped me practice creating page structures with HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.
